	<p>  From PETA: Considered by animal behaviorists to be smarter than dogs, pigs are clever animals who are also friendly, loyal, and intelligent. They are naturally very clean and avoid soiling their living areas. When they are not confined on factory farms, pigs spend hours playing, lying in the sun, and exploring their surroundings with their powerful sense of smell. On modern farms, these outgoing, sensitive animals spend their entire lives in cramped, filthy warehouses under the constant stress of intense confinement and are denied everything that is natural and important to them. Mother pigs (sows) spend most of their miserable lives in tiny gestation and farrowing crates so small that they canâ€™t even turn around. They are impregnated again and again until their bodies give out and are then sent to slaughter. Piglets are torn away from their distraught mothers just a few weeks after birth. Their tails are chopped off, the ends of their teeth are snipped off with pliers, and the males are castrated. No painkillers are given to them to ease their suffering. The young pigs then spend their short lives in cramped, crowded pens on slabs of filthy concrete. <a href="pig table.html"> Remake your decision? </a> </p>
