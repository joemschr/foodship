<p>This alien does not like the fact that you chose to eat them. Why would you make such a decision? Is it because this is a living thing that is not a human? How does your decision process look when consuming other living creatures? In the future, should aliens be viewed as animals or humans? What is the determining factor of what we eat and don't eat? Would you potentially eat a humanoid creature that is not human? Why is that, what factors into your decision?</p>
